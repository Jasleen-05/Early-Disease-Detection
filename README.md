# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including heart disease, are the leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection of heart disease is critical for preventing serious health outcomes and improving the quality of life for patients. With the increasing availability of medical data, machine learning models can be used to predict whether a patient is likely to develop heart disease based on certain health indicators.

In this project, you will build a classification model to predict whether an individual is likely to have heart disease or not. The dataset provided includes various health and demographic factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking and alcohol consumption). The goal is to train a model to identify which individuals have heart disease based on these features.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to build a classification model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease. Using health and demographic data, we aim to identify high-risk individuals, enabling healthcare providers to take preventive actions and reduce the risk of severe cardiovascular events.

## üöÄ Features

* Predict heart disease based on health indicators.
* Provide actionable insights for early intervention.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
* **Modeling Techniques:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jasleen-05/Early-Disease-Detection.git
   cd Early-Disease-Detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare the dataset for training and testing.

4. Run the model script:

   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```

## üßÆ Evaluation Metrics

Since this is a classification problem, the following evaluation metrics will be used:

* **Confusion Matrix:** To visualize TP, FP, TN, FN.
* **Accuracy:** $(TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN)$
* **Precision:** $TP / (TP + FP)$
* **Recall (Sensitivity):** $TP / (TP + FN)$
* **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
