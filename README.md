# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including heart disease, are the leading cause of death globally. Early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes and quality of life. This project leverages machine learning to predict whether an individual is likely to develop heart disease based on health indicators such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking and alcohol consumption).

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to build a classification model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease. Using health and demographic data, we aim to identify high-risk individuals, enabling healthcare providers to take preventive actions and reduce the risk of severe cardiovascular events.

## 🚀 Features

* Predict heart disease based on health indicators.
* Classify individuals as high-risk or low-risk for heart disease.
* Provide actionable insights for early intervention.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
* **Modeling Techniques:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jasleen-05/Early-Disease-Detection.git
   cd Early-Disease-Detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare the dataset for training and testing.

4. Run the model script:

   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```

## 🧮 Evaluation Metrics

Since this is a classification problem, the following evaluation metrics will be used:

* **Confusion Matrix:** To visualize TP, FP, TN, FN.
* **Accuracy:** $(TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN)$
* **Precision:** $TP / (TP + FP)$
* **Recall (Sensitivity):** $TP / (TP + FN)$
* **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
